## Prompts

This application was built using the following prompts to generate the content structure and code:

### Content Model Prompt

> No content model prompt provided - app built from existing content structure

### Code Generation Prompt

> this is my project was "Ai Dropout prediction" and done with first of model train and also completed in 'counsellor login' page and we have two more page. One is 'Teacher login' and 'student login'. But now i am take the initial step of plan to complete my side work. My work in this project create a teacher login and inside the login: 1. Student data entry --> predict Risk (low, moderate, high, very high) --> Assigned to counsellor + File upload in same page. 2. in file upload next page --> AI recommendation for understanding the key words. Types of Recommendations include Academic, Financial, Emotional/Psychological, Social/Peer, and Time Management categories with automatic generation based on student data and counselor reports.

The app has been tailored to work with your existing Cosmic content structure and includes all the features requested above.

## Cosmic SDK Examples

### Fetching Student Data
```typescript
import { cosmic } from '@/lib/cosmic'

const { objects: students } = await cosmic.objects
  .find({ type: 'students' })
  .props(['id', 'title', 'slug', 'metadata'])
  .depth(1)
```

### Creating Risk Assessment
```typescript
await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  title: `Risk Assessment - ${studentName}`,
  type: 'risk-assessments',
  metadata: {
    student: studentId,
    risk_level: 'High',
    prediction_score: 0.87,
    assigned_counselor: counselorId,
    assessment_date: new Date().toISOString()
  }
})
```

### Generating AI Recommendations
```typescript
await cosmic.objects.insertOne({
  title: `Recommendations - ${studentName}`,
  type: 'recommendations',
  metadata: {
    student: studentId,
    risk_assessment: assessmentId,
    category: 'Academic',
    recommendation_text: 'Enroll in remedial math course',
    status: 'Pending',
    approved_by_teacher: false
  }
})
```
